WordPress Simple Page Ordering
==============================

Order your pages and other hierarchical post types with simple drag and drop right from the standard page list.

##Overview
This plugin lets you drag and drop the pages in the WordPress admin panel to change their order.

##Note
This is a fork of the [Simple Page Ordering](http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-page-ordering/) (V. 2.1.2) plugin from the offical WordPress plugin directory.

IÂ´m hosting the plugin here to use it as submodule in my projects.
